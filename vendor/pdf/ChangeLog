= PDF::Writer Change Log

== PDF::Writer 1.1.3: September 9, 2005
* Fixed #2356 submitted by Matthew Thill. Margins set by the various margins
  methods would behave incorrectly.

== PDF::Writer 1.1.2: August 25, 2005
* Thomas Gantner <thomas.gantner@gmx.net> found a problem with the
  interpretation of the placement of page numbers and provided a patch.
  Thanks!
* Thomas also reported a problem with an inability to place page numbering on
  the first page of a document, as well as strange results from not providing
  a starting page number. This has been fixed. Also reported as #2204.
* Modified PDF::Writer requirements to require color-tools version 1.3.0 or
  later. This necessitates that Color constants be changed to Color::RGB
  constants.
* Updated supporting library documentation to include information on
   color-tools version 1.3.
* Fixed a bug with Graphics#transform_matrix truncating one of the transform
  parameters.
* Applied a fix to PDF::SimpleTable submitted by Mike Leddy in #2129 on the
  RubyForge tracker.
* Applied a partial fix for PNG with index-transparency provided by Marc
  Vleugels in #2245 on the RubyForge tracker. NOTE: This does not solve the
  transparency problem; at this point, PDF::Writer cannot be said to support
  PNGs with transparency. This will be fixed in a later version of
  PDF::Writer.

== PDF::Writer 1.1.1: July 1, 2005
* Fixed the packaging process; the .tar.gz files will no longer corrupt the
  images.
* Added the images and the manual (both raw and generated) to the demo
  package.

== PDF::Writer 1.1.0: June 29, 2005
  NOTE: The first two changes are INCOMPATIBLE with previous versions of
  PDF::Writer. If you find that your text is showing up at odd angles, negate
  the value. That is, if you have 90 as your angle, use -90 (or 270) as your
  angle and it will work like it used to.

* Axis transformations in PDF::Writer::Graphics have been fixed.
* Text axis transformation in PDF::Writer#add_text has been fixed.
* Changed #text_width and #text_line_width so that the text value is the
  first parameter and the size parameter is second, and is optional. The code
  warns about it now, but it will break in PDF::Writer 2.0.
* Changed #add_text and #add_text_wrap so that the text parameter is before
  the now-optional size parameter. The code warns about it now, but it will
  break in PDF::Writer 2.0.
* Added #transform_matrix.
* Fixed compression. NOTE: Compression must be set early in the documentation
  process, or only some items will be compressed in the document. The various
  #save_as methods have been changed to reflect this fact.
* Enabled the placement of encoding differences dictionaries in the resulting
  PDF document. This change should be considered experimental.
* Added TTF licence checking. The embedding of a file not licenced for
  inclusion in a document will continue, but a warning will be output to
  standard error. This code has been gakked from FPDF (http://www.fpdf.org).
* Properly supporting symbolic font flags now.
* Added support and documentation for a separately downloadable demo package.
* Expanded the installation documentation.
* Added the ability to make images clickable links with any of the three
  image insertion methods.

== PDF::Writer 1.0.1: June 13, 2005
* Fixed a few minor gem issues.
* Renamed bin/manual to bin/techbook.
* Fixed the manual.pwd locator for the default install.

== PDF::Writer 1.0.0: June 12, 2005
* Integrated ezwriter.rb functionality with writer.rb.
* Factored out some functionality into modules and classes.
* Added CMYK colour support to JPEG images.
* Uses Color::CMYK (from color-utils) to provide CMYK support to drawing
  capabilities.
* Simplified the image API significantly.
* Modified image support to properly handle full image flipping.
* Fixed several multi-column issues.
* Fixed a bug where new pages automatically started by overflowing text may
  have resulted in writing the first line of text above the top margin. This
  may need further testing and probably causes problems with column handling.
* Fixed some page numbering issues.
* Added several demos, including Ruby Quick Reference Sheets.
* Scrubbed the API.
* Updated the documentation.
* Changed installer to setup.rb 3.3.1-modified.
* Applied an image resize patch; the image will be resized manually before
  checking to see if a new page is required. Thanks to Leslie Hensley.
* Fixed a bug where entities would generate the width specified for the
  component characters, not the represented characters.
* Fixed a performance bug. Thanks again to Leslie Hensley.

== PDF::Writer 0.1.2: CVS only
* Fixed a problem with the improper reading of character numbers from .afm
  files that are not default files. Other font issues remain but will be fixed
  at a later date.

== PDF::Writer 0.1.0: September, 2003
* Initial technology preview.
