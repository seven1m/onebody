    tips:
      - <em>nil</em> is not the same as an empty string. You may have to test for both, using an [or] group.
      - The 'child' attribute is only <em>true/false</em> in cases where the birthday is unknown; otherwise, it is <em>nil</em>.
      - For the best results in searching for adults, specify 'birthday' is <em>less than</em> "YYYY-MM-DD" (replace with the appropriate date) [or] 'child' is <em>false</em>
      - The 'gender' attribute can only be "Male", "Female", or nil.
      - The <em>matches</em> operator (and the case-insensitive version) require knowledge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expressions</a>. Use the <em>contains</em> operator for simple searches.
