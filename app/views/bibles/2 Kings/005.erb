  <h2>2 Kings 5</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:1" id="2_Kings-5-1">Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:2" id="2_Kings-5-2">The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman&#8217;s wife.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:3" id="2_Kings-5-3">She said to her mistress, &#8220;I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:4" id="2_Kings-5-4">Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, &#8220;The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:5" id="2_Kings-5-5">The king of Syria said, &#8220;Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.&#8221; He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:6" id="2_Kings-5-6">He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, &#8220;Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:7" id="2_Kings-5-7">It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, &#8220;Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:8" id="2_Kings-5-8">It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, &#8220;Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:9" id="2_Kings-5-9">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:10" id="2_Kings-5-10">Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, &#8220;Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:11" id="2_Kings-5-11">But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, &#8220;Behold, I thought, &#8216;He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:12" id="2_Kings-5-12">Aren&#8217;t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn&#8217;t I wash in them, and be clean?&#8221; So he turned and went away in a rage.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:13" id="2_Kings-5-13">His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, &#8220;My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn&#8217;t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, &#8216;Wash, and be clean?&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:14" id="2_Kings-5-14">Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:15" id="2_Kings-5-15">He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, &#8220;See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:16" id="2_Kings-5-16">But he said, &#8220;As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.&#8221; He urged him to take it; but he refused.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:17" id="2_Kings-5-17">Naaman said, &#8220;If not, then, please let two mules&#8217; burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:18" id="2_Kings-5-18">In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:19" id="2_Kings-5-19">He said to him, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; So he departed from him a little way.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:20" id="2_Kings-5-20">But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, &#8220;Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:21" id="2_Kings-5-21">So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, &#8220;Is all well?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:22" id="2_Kings-5-22">He said, &#8220;All is well. My master has sent me, saying, &#8216;Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:23" id="2_Kings-5-23">Naaman said, &#8220;Be pleased to take two talents.&#8221; He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:24" id="2_Kings-5-24">When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:25" id="2_Kings-5-25">But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, &#8220;Where did you come from, Gehazi?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Your servant went nowhere.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:26" id="2_Kings-5-26">He said to him, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 5:27" id="2_Kings-5-27">Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your seed forever.&#8221; He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.</span>
