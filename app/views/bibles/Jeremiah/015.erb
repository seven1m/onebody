  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 15:10" id="Jeremiah-15-10">Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; yet everyone of them curses me.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 15:15" id="Jeremiah-15-15">Yahweh, you know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; don&#8217;t take me away in your longsuffering: know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 15:16" id="Jeremiah-15-16">Your words were found, and I ate them; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, Yahweh, God of Armies.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 15:18" id="Jeremiah-15-18">Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Will you indeed be to me as a deceitful brook, as waters that fail?</span>
