  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:1" id="Jeremiah-41-1">Now it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:2" id="Jeremiah-41-2">Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:3" id="Jeremiah-41-3">Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:5" id="Jeremiah-41-5">that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:6" id="Jeremiah-41-6">Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it happened, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:7" id="Jeremiah-41-7">It was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:8" id="Jeremiah-41-8">But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Don&#8217;t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he stopped, and didn&#8217;t kill them among their brothers.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:9" id="Jeremiah-41-9">Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was who which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:10" id="Jeremiah-41-10">Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king&#8217;s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:11" id="Jeremiah-41-11">But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:12" id="Jeremiah-41-12">then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:13" id="Jeremiah-41-13">Now it happened that, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:14" id="Jeremiah-41-14">So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:15" id="Jeremiah-41-15">But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:16" id="Jeremiah-41-16">Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:17" id="Jeremiah-41-17">and they departed, and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 41:18" id="Jeremiah-41-18">because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.</span>
