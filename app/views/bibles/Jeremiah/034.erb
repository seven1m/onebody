  <h2>Jeremiah 34</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:1" id="Jeremiah-34-1">The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of it, saying:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:2" id="Jeremiah-34-2">Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:3" id="Jeremiah-34-3">and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:4" id="Jeremiah-34-4">Yet hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus says Yahweh concerning you, You shall not die by the sword;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:5" id="Jeremiah-34-5">you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they shall lament you, saying, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, says Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:6" id="Jeremiah-34-6">Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:7" id="Jeremiah-34-7">when the king of Babylon&#8217;s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:8" id="Jeremiah-34-8">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:9" id="Jeremiah-34-9">that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:10" id="Jeremiah-34-10">All the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant, go free, that none should make bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:11" id="Jeremiah-34-11">but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:12" id="Jeremiah-34-12">Therefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:13" id="Jeremiah-34-13">Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:14" id="Jeremiah-34-14">At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers didn&#8217;t listen to me, neither inclined their ear.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:15" id="Jeremiah-34-15">You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:16" id="Jeremiah-34-16">but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:17" id="Jeremiah-34-17">Therefore thus says Yahweh: you have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says Yahweh, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:18" id="Jeremiah-34-18">I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:19" id="Jeremiah-34-19">the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:20" id="Jeremiah-34-20">I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:21" id="Jeremiah-34-21">Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon&#8217;s army, who have gone away from you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 34:22" id="Jeremiah-34-22">Behold, I will command, says Yahweh, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.</span>
