  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:3" id="Exodus-14-3">Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, &#8216;They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.&#8217;</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:5" id="Exodus-14-5">It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, &#8220;What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:6" id="Exodus-14-6">He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him;</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:12" id="Exodus-14-12">Isn&#8217;t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, &#8216;Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?&#8217; For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:13" id="Exodus-14-13">Moses said to the people, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:19" id="Exodus-14-19">The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:20" id="Exodus-14-20">It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one didn&#8217;t come near the other all the night.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:21" id="Exodus-14-21">Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:25" id="Exodus-14-25">He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 14:26" id="Exodus-14-26">Yahweh said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.&#8221;</span>
