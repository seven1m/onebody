  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 26:16" id="2_Chronicles-26-16">But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Yahweh his God; for he went into the temple of Yahweh to burn incense on the altar of incense.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 26:17" id="2_Chronicles-26-17">Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 26:18" id="2_Chronicles-26-18">and they resisted Uzziah the king, and said to him, &#8220;It isn&#8217;t for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for your honor from Yahweh God.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 26:19" id="2_Chronicles-26-19">Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 26:21" id="2_Chronicles-26-21">Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh: and Jotham his son was over the king&#8217;s house, judging the people of the land.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 26:22" id="2_Chronicles-26-22">Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 26:23" id="2_Chronicles-26-23">So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, &#8220;He is a leper.&#8221; Jotham his son reigned in his place.</span>
