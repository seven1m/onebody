  <h2>Daniel 7</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:1" id="Daniel-7-1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:2" id="Daniel-7-2">Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:3" id="Daniel-7-3">Four great animals came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:4" id="Daniel-7-4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle&#8217;s wings: I saw until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man; and a man&#8217;s heart was given to it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:5" id="Daniel-7-5">Behold, another animal, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:6" id="Daniel-7-6">After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the animal had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:7" id="Daniel-7-7">After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the animals that were before it; and it had ten horns.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:8" id="Daniel-7-8">I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:9" id="Daniel-7-9">I saw until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and its wheels burning fire.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:10" id="Daniel-7-10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:11" id="Daniel-7-11">I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I saw even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:12" id="Daniel-7-12">As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:13" id="Daniel-7-13">I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:14" id="Daniel-7-14">There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:15" id="Daniel-7-15">As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:16" id="Daniel-7-16">I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:17" id="Daniel-7-17">These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:18" id="Daniel-7-18">But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:19" id="Daniel-7-19">Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:20" id="Daniel-7-20">and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:21" id="Daniel-7-21">I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:22" id="Daniel-7-22">until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:23" id="Daniel-7-23">Thus he said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:24" id="Daniel-7-24">As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:25" id="Daniel-7-25">He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:26" id="Daniel-7-26">But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:27" id="Daniel-7-27">The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Daniel 7:28" id="Daniel-7-28">Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my face was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</span>
