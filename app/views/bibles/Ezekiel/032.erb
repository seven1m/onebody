  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:1" id="Ezekiel-32-1">It happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:2" id="Ezekiel-32-2">Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him, You were likened to a young lion of the nations: yet you are as a monster in the seas; and you broke out with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:3" id="Ezekiel-32-3">Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring you up in my net.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:4" id="Ezekiel-32-4">I will leave you on the land, I will cast you forth on the open field, and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you, and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:5" id="Ezekiel-32-5">I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:6" id="Ezekiel-32-6">I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:7" id="Ezekiel-32-7">When I shall extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:8" id="Ezekiel-32-8">All the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you, and set darkness on your land, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:9" id="Ezekiel-32-9">I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:10" id="Ezekiel-32-10">Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:11" id="Ezekiel-32-11">For thus says the Lord Yahweh: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:12" id="Ezekiel-32-12">By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 32:16" id="Ezekiel-32-16">This is the lamentation with which they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
