  <h2>Ezekiel 29</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:1" id="Ezekiel-29-1">In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:2" id="Ezekiel-29-2">&#8220;Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:3" id="Ezekiel-29-3">Speak and say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord Yahweh: &#8220;Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, that has said, &#8216;My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:4" id="Ezekiel-29-4">I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:5" id="Ezekiel-29-5">I&#8217;ll cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. You&#8217;ll fall on the open field. You won&#8217;t be brought together, nor gathered. I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:6" id="Ezekiel-29-6">All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:7" id="Ezekiel-29-7">When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke, and paralyzed all of their thighs.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:8" id="Ezekiel-29-8">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: &#8220;Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and animal from you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:9" id="Ezekiel-29-9">The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Yahweh. Because he has said, &#8216;The river is mine, and I have made it;&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:10" id="Ezekiel-29-10">therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:11" id="Ezekiel-29-11">No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:12" id="Ezekiel-29-12">I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:13" id="Ezekiel-29-13">For thus says the Lord Yahweh: &#8220;At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:14" id="Ezekiel-29-14">and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:15" id="Ezekiel-29-15">It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:16" id="Ezekiel-29-16">It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:17" id="Ezekiel-29-17">It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:18" id="Ezekiel-29-18">Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:19" id="Ezekiel-29-19">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:20" id="Ezekiel-29-20">I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they worked for me, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 29:21" id="Ezekiel-29-21">In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth to the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>
