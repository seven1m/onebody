  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:3" id="Leviticus-6-3">or has found that which was lost, and dealt falsely therein, and swearing to a lie; in any of all these things that a man does, sinning therein;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:4" id="Leviticus-6-4">then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:5" id="Leviticus-6-5">or any thing about which he has sworn falsely; he shall restore it even in full, and shall add a fifth part more to it. To him to whom it belongs he shall give it, in the day of his being found guilty.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:17" id="Leviticus-6-17">It shall not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:21" id="Leviticus-6-21">It shall be made with oil in a griddle. When it is soaked, you shall bring it in. You shall offer the meal offering in baked pieces for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:25" id="Leviticus-6-25">&#8220;Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, &#8216;This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before Yahweh. It is most holy.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:26" id="Leviticus-6-26">The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 6:27" id="Leviticus-6-27">Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy. When there is any of its blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in a holy place.</span>
