  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 37:19" id="Isaiah-37-19">and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men&#8217;s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 37:29" id="Isaiah-37-29">Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 37:30" id="Isaiah-37-30">This shall be the sign to you. You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span>
