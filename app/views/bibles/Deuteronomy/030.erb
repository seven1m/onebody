  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 30:10" id="Deuteronomy-30-10">if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 30:11" id="Deuteronomy-30-11">For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 30:12" id="Deuteronomy-30-12">It is not in heaven, that you should say, &#8220;Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?&#8221;</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 30:17" id="Deuteronomy-30-17">But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 30:18" id="Deuteronomy-30-18">I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 30:19" id="Deuteronomy-30-19">I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 30:20" id="Deuteronomy-30-20">to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.</span>
