  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:1" id="Deuteronomy-20-1">When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:2" id="Deuteronomy-20-2">It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:3" id="Deuteronomy-20-3">and shall tell them, &#8220;Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies: don&#8217;t let your heart faint; don&#8217;t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:4" id="Deuteronomy-20-4">for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:5" id="Deuteronomy-20-5">The officers shall speak to the people, saying, &#8220;What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:6" id="Deuteronomy-20-6">What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:9" id="Deuteronomy-20-9">It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:10" id="Deuteronomy-20-10">When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:11" id="Deuteronomy-20-11">It shall be, if it makes you answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:12" id="Deuteronomy-20-12">If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:13" id="Deuteronomy-20-13">and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:14" id="Deuteronomy-20-14">but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its spoil, you shall take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:15" id="Deuteronomy-20-15">Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:16" id="Deuteronomy-20-16">But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:17" id="Deuteronomy-20-17">but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Yahweh your God has commanded you;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:18" id="Deuteronomy-20-18">that they not teach you to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against Yahweh your God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:19" id="Deuteronomy-20-19">When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of you?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 20:20" id="Deuteronomy-20-20">Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it fall.</span>
