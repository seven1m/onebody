Thank you for praying this week.  Enjoy your time this week talking to God.

You have signed up for the following time(s):
<% @times.each do |time| -%>
* <%= time.start.strftime '%A %I:%M %p' %>
<% end -%>

If you are praying between the hours of 9:00am and 5:00pm you may enter
through the west doors of the church.

If your time to pray is after 5:00pm you will need to enter through the
glass doors outside the hospitality room.  This is on the east side
of the building.

There is a lock box with the key inside it.  The combination to the lock
box is 2424.  There is a little black lever next to the numbers; push down
on it and the door will swing open.  Use the key to access the building,
replace the key in the box and close the door.

If you have difficulty getting into the church, please call Larry
at 361-7891 or Rich Pippin at 810-0644.
