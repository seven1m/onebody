== Transaction::Simple 1.4.0 / 2007.02.03

* Adding a post-rewind hook (#_post_transaction_rewind) so that complex
  graph objects can correct themselves after rewinding. See the
  documentation for #rewind_transaction and tests/tc_broken_graph.rb for
  more information.
* Removed all warnings.
* Deprecated the #transaction method.
* Various administrative changes:
  - Converted to a hoe-driven project.
  - Made the gem and .tar.gz files idempotent.
  - Cleaned up the code a little further.
  - Changed non-gem installer to setup.rb version 3.4.1.

== Transaction::Simple 1.3.1

* Explicitly clearing the transaction checkpoint on objects when the
  last open transaction is committed or aborted.
* Fixed up behaviour to remove a lot of #respond_to? calls.

== Transaction::Simple 1.3.0

* Updated to fix a lot of warnings.
* Added a per-transaction-object list of excluded instance variables.
* Moved Transaction::simple::ThreadSafe to transaction/simple/threadsafe.
* Added transaction groups. Transaction groups are wrapper objects to
  allow the coordination of transactions with a group of objects. There
  are both normal and threadsafe versions of transaction groups.
* Fixed a long-standing problem where instance variables that were added
  to an object after a transaction was started would remain.
* Reorganised unit tests.

== Transaction::Simple 1.2.0

* Added a RubyGem.
* Added a block form of Transaction::Simple.

== Transaction::Simple 1.1.1

* Cleaned up some documentation.

== Transaction::Simple 1.1

* Added Transaction::Simple::ThreadSafe for truly atomic and thread-safe
  transactions.
* Fixed the description of Transaction::Simple to note that it is *not*
  atomic because it is not implicitly thread-safe.
* Added support for named transactions. Named transactions can be used to
  make checkpoints that can be committed, aborted, or rewound without
  explicitly committing, aborting, or rewinding the intervening
  transactions.

== Transaction::Simple 1.0

* Created. Initial release.
